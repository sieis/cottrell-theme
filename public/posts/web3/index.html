        Web3
    </h2>
        <h2 id="a-little-late">A Little Late</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m one of the dumb ones.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been in the know regarding Bitcoin and blockchain and the next wave of the internet (Web3) for many years. I just haven&rsquo;t paid it any attention.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;ve been getting curious again, and I decided to take a quick course after stumbling across a relatively new ed-tech company, _buildspace.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re a YCombinator company, and pivoted from earlier educational ideas under the name ZipSchool to land on the Web3 space.</p>
<p>Blockchain, Cryptocurrency, Decentralized Apps and other buzz-worthy concepts are flying around the internet these days. And rightly so, as the technology underlying them is quite facinating.</p>
<p>Being a novice still, myself, I won&rsquo;t try and dissect the details here, but rather give a thumbs up for dipping your toes into Web3 if you haven&rsquo;t done so yet.</p>
<p>The courses they&rsquo;ve offered thus far have spanned from Smart Contracts on the Blockchain (what I just finished) to minting an NFT (signing up for this one next) to creating a decentralized Twitter clone.</p>
<h2 id="starting-out">Starting Out</h2>
<p>At the onset of our 1-2 week project, Farza, the lead instructor, hosted a live Twitch walkthrough of the course from a high level.</p>
<p>This was a simple and effective nice first step. Whether it&rsquo;s entirely necessary or just baked into my own educational-DNA, having a live teacher-led component (even for just that initial kick-off hour) may have made the difference between browsing through the content and actually making a beginning on it.</p>
<p>The course itself is nicely managed in their online web app, and felt better than other courses I&rsquo;ve taken on EdX and Coursera. It benefits from an early stage, small team who embraces the colorful energy, serious subjects and lean paragraphs of web developers and good documentation.</p>
<p>The progress bar at the top added that gamified flare that was never a distraction, but rather a proper, subtle motivating force through the course.</p>
<h2 id="feet-wet">Feet Wet</h2>
<p>I brought some traditional programming skills into the course, and I think it is necessary to get the full benefit here. A lot of the content can be copied/pasted if you are just flying through and blindly following directions, but as a developer myself, I was able to wrap my head around what was going on.</p>
<p>The course itself is definitly just an overview, but for someone like me who was pretty clueless about anything past the buzz words of Web3, it was a wonderful introduction to how the pieces fit together.</p>
<p>We constructed an actual smart contract, tested it on a local Ethereum network, setup a Cryptowallet (Metamask), deployed the functioning smart contract to a real, live testnet (which lets us emulate the actual Etherum network without paying out real eth or $$$). We built a front end on Replit and spruced it up before connecting our contract to the actual website.</p>
<p>And we made some updates to the contract so that it could store user input messages on the blockchain, and randomly select users to win a little bit of eth.</p>
<p>Props to _buildspace. I think their pivot into Web3 education is going to be a solid move for them over the coming several years.</p>
<p>And, as an added bonus, all their curriculum is open source on Github which let me become a contributor to the project by correcting some typos in the project curriculum! Fun stuff!</p>
<h2 id="thanks">Thanks!</h2>
<p>Hey, thanks for reading. I&rsquo;m incredibly interested in web development, and write about my journey here. I&rsquo;ve got a handful of podcasts that sap any leftover creative energy!</p>
