I Want to Hack began way back in 2012 when I first began dabbling in computer programming. I began with an EdX course on Python from MIT. This was when MOOCs were just coming on the scene, and I was fascinated. I was joined by my wife on the podcast where I would attempt to explain to her what I'd been learning. The show was rekindled to continue in this vein during 2020, and remains a personal progress beacon for me.
