## A powerful ally

I've setup a custom subdomain that points to [https://blog.eamonncottrell.com/](https://blog.eamonncottrell.com/).

This'll be where my posts live going forward. I love the Hugo site I've built here, but for the sake of extended reach and utilizing an actual developer-centric blogging platform, I will be posting primarily on Hashnode going forward.

I wrote about the setup [here](https://blog.eamonncottrell.com/hashnode-subdomain-with-netlify-and-google-domain).

I'm a quarter of the way through a [100 Days of Code](https://twitter.com/hashtag/100DaysOfCode?src=hashtag_click) challenge. 

And this is a part of Quincy Larson's (freeCodeCamp) [Become-a-Dev 2022 Challenge](https://twitter.com/ossia/status/1476581551873925123).

It was part of his challenge to begin blogging (which I already was) on Hashnode specifically.
