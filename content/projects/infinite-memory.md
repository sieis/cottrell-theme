## Overview

I built a memory tool for a February 2022 [Hackathon](https://townhall.hashnode.com/netlify-hackathon) with [Hashnode](https://hashnode.com/) & [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

Here's the **code**: https://github.com/sieis/infinite-memory

Here's the **live site**: https://infinite-memory.netlify.app/

Here's a **blog post** I wrote about building it: https://blog.eamonncottrell.com/infinite-memory

I am memorizing scripture with a [CLC](https://www.clchq.org/) group, and devised this app to both help us learn and work on my Javascript.

The app is composed entirely in HTML, CSS and Javascript. I wanted it lightweight and to avoid any frameworks. An overview of how to use is below.

## How to Use

1. Click a button for one of the verses. The card section for that verse will appear below.
1. You can toggle the verse on and off as well as remove words one at a time for practice.
1. A podcast episode is available to play with original musical composition and a reciting of each verse.
1. There is a form at the bottom to type the verse from memory and check for accuracy.
