This is meant to address the more common web needs of a group. Namely, a clean, readable and easily accessible site for any member to:

1. Find basic information about the meeting. i.e. location, times, format.
1. Access the meeting guide and participate without the need for paper handouts.
1. Access any online only meeting resources.
1. Contribute donations to the group easily online.
