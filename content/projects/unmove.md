## Properly Building and Maintaining an Open Source Project

I wanted to learn better project management, so I created a small open-source library to teach myself some best practices for developing a software project.

This was a helpful way to learn more about many things including:

1. git branches (and acutually using them 😊)
1. GitHub Issues (closing, not just opening them 🤯)
1. Assigning tasks via GitHub Projects (to myself 😁)
1. Writing concise documentation 📖
1. Thoughtfully considering contribution guidelines ✍
1. Licensing properly 📃
1. Using git tags and versioning properly 🔖
1. Making available as a CDN via jsDelivr 🌎
1. Making (and releasing!) an MVP (minimum viable product) 🚀
1. Focusing on process over code (without neglecting the code 👀)

I wrote an article about this project here: https://blog.eamonncottrell.com/build-an-open-source-css-library
