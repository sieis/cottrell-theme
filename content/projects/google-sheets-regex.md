## Google Sheets FTW

I love Google Sheets, and I use them extensively both at work and in my personal projects.

This project originated with some issues I was having at work across several linked spreadsheets. I was having to manually add multiple images each month to several different spreadsheets.

This was tedious and quite terrible :smile: 

During the course of implementing a solution, I wrote an article about the process [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/google-sheets-use-regex-and-vlookup-to-display-images-from-google-drive/), and created a demo sheet with the techniques I used [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rFU2gPy6rU8IKFDmsxKHYCf0KGVHkcumQ5O5QCf156M/edit#gid=0).

Check out [the demo](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rFU2gPy6rU8IKFDmsxKHYCf0KGVHkcumQ5O5QCf156M/edit#gid=0), and let me know what you think. I had a great time both getting the functionality nailed down as well as making the sheet more asthetically pleasing!
